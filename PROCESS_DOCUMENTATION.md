## Development Process

### Phase 1: Project Setup (30 minutes)

**Decisions:**
- **Next.js 16** over Create React App: Better for API routes, serverless-friendly
- **TypeScript**: Type safety critical for API responses
- **Tailwind CSS**: Fast styling, modern design system
- **Puppeteer**: Industry standard for web scraping

**AI Assistance:**
- Used Cursor to generate project structure
- Copilot suggested optimal dependency versions

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (2 hours)

**Iteration 1: Basic Crawler**
- Started with simple Puppeteer setup
- Extracted basic HTML structure
- **Issue**: Too much data, needed filtering

**Iteration 2: Structured Data Extraction**
- Focused on specific elements (images, links, forms)
- Added computed style extraction
- **Decision**: Limit HTML to 50k chars to stay within API limits

**AI Assistance:**
- Cursor generated Puppeteer evaluation scripts
- Copilot suggested efficient DOM queries

### Phase 3: AI Integration (2 hours)

**Iteration 1: Simple Prompt**
- Basic prompt asking for issues
- **Issue**: Inconsistent output format

**Iteration 2: Structured Prompt**
- Added JSON schema specification
- Included example format
- Added category definitions
- **Result**: More reliable parsing

**Iteration 3: Error Handling**
- Added try-catch for JSON parsing
- Fallback findings if AI fails
- **Decision**: Graceful degradation over failing completely

**AI Assistance:**
- Used Cursor to refine prompts iteratively
- Tested with Claude API directly before integration

### Phase 4: UI Development (2 hours)

**Iteration 1: Basic Form**
- Simple input and button
- **Issue**: No visual feedback

**Iteration 2: Loading States**
- Added spinner and disabled states
- Progress indicators
- **Decision**: Clear user feedback essential

**Iteration 3: Results Display**
- Summary cards with statistics
- Individual finding cards
- Color-coded severity
- **Decision**: Progressive disclosure (summary → details)

**AI Assistance:**
- Cursor generated component structure
- Copilot suggested Tailwind classes
- Used AI to refine color schemes

### Phase 5: Polish & Documentation (1.5 hours)

**Additions:**
- Screenshot display
- Code snippet formatting
- Error messages
- Responsive design
- README and deployment guides

**AI Assistance:**
- Generated comprehensive README
- Created deployment documentation
- Wrote case study summary

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Single-Page Analysis Only

**Decision:** Analyze only the provided URL, not entire sites

**Rationale:**
- Keeps scope manageable for 8-hour constraint
- Most valuable for landing pages and key pages
- Can be extended later

**Trade-off:**
- Less comprehensive than full-site audits
- But faster and more focused

### 2. Puppeteer over Playwright

**Decision:** Use Puppeteer for web scraping

**Rationale:**
- Lighter weight
- Sufficient for single-page analysis
- Better documentation
- Easier to configure

**Trade-off:**
- Playwright has better cross-browser support
- But not needed for this use case

### 3. Claude over GPT-4

**Decision:** Use Anthropic Claude API

**Rationale:**
- Better structured output
- More reliable JSON parsing
- Better at following instructions
- Competitive pricing

**Trade-off:**
- GPT-4 has larger context window
- But Claude sufficient for this task

### 4. Server-Side API Route

**Decision:** Use Next.js API routes instead of client-side calls

**Rationale:**
- Keeps API keys secure
- Better error handling
- Can handle long-running operations
- Serverless-friendly

**Trade-off:**
- Requires server resources
- But necessary for Puppeteer and API security

### 5. Severity-Based Prioritization

**Decision:** Categorize findings by severity (critical, high, medium, low)

**Rationale:**
- Helps users prioritize fixes
- Matches industry standards
- Improves UX of results

**Trade-off:**
- AI may not always categorize correctly
- But provides valuable guidance

## Iterations & Refinements

### Prompt Engineering Iterations

**Version 1:** "Analyze this website for UX issues"
- Too vague, inconsistent results

**Version 2:** "Find accessibility, usability, and design issues"
- Better, but still unstructured

**Version 3:** Current version with:
- Clear categories
- JSON schema
- Example format
- Specific instructions
- **Result:** Reliable, structured output

### UI Iterations

**Version 1:** Simple list of findings
- Hard to scan
- No prioritization

**Version 2:** Added summary cards
- Better overview
- Still hard to navigate

**Version 3:** Current version with:
- Summary dashboard
- Color-coded severity
- Expandable details
- Code snippets
- Screenshots
- **Result:** Professional, actionable

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Puppeteer in Serverless

**Problem:** Puppeteer requires Chromium, large for serverless

**Solution:** 
- Use standard Puppeteer for now
- Document @sparticuz/chromium alternative
- Note Vercel memory limits

### Challenge 2: API Response Parsing

**Problem:** AI sometimes returns non-JSON text

**Solution:**
- Added regex to extract JSON from response
- Fallback findings if parsing fails
- Error handling for edge cases

### Challenge 3: Timeout Limits

**Problem:** Audits can take 30-60 seconds

**Solution:**
- Configured 60-second timeout in vercel.json
- Optimized Puppeteer settings
- Added loading states

### Challenge 4: Rate Limits

**Problem:** Anthropic API has rate limits

**Solution:**
- Documented in deployment guide
- Added error handling
- Suggested monitoring
