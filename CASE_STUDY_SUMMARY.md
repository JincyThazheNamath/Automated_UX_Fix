# AI UX Audit Agent - Case Study Summary

## Why – The Problem

Digital agencies and product teams face significant challenges in conducting comprehensive UX audits:

1. **Time-Consuming Process**: Manual UX audits require hours of expert review, making them expensive and slow
2. **Inconsistent Results**: Human audits vary based on reviewer expertise and subjective interpretation
3. **Missed Issues**: Critical accessibility and usability problems often go undetected without systematic analysis
4. **Scalability Limitations**: Agencies struggle to audit multiple client websites efficiently
5. **Knowledge Gap**: Many teams lack deep expertise in accessibility standards (WCAG) and UX best practices

The result: websites launch with preventable UX issues, leading to poor user experiences, accessibility violations, and lost conversion opportunities.

## What – The Solution

**AI UX Audit Agent** is an intelligent, automated tool that performs comprehensive UX analysis in seconds:

- **Automated Website Analysis**: Crawls and analyzes any website using Puppeteer
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses Claude AI to identify issues across five key categories:
  - Accessibility (WCAG compliance, alt text, ARIA labels)
  - Usability (navigation, CTAs, form design)
  - Design Consistency (colors, typography, spacing)
  - Performance (image optimization, loading)
  - SEO (meta tags, semantic HTML)
- **Prioritized Findings**: Issues categorized by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Each finding includes specific suggestions and code snippets
- **Visual Context**: Captures screenshots for better understanding
- **Professional Reports**: Clean, shareable audit reports

**Key Innovation**: Combines web scraping, AI analysis, and automated reporting to deliver enterprise-grade UX audits in under 30 seconds—work that typically takes hours.

## Who – The User Segment

**Primary Users:**
1. **Digital Agencies** (like Lunim Studio)
   - Need to audit client websites quickly
   - Want to offer UX audit as a service
   - Require consistent, professional reports

2. **Product Teams & UX Designers**
   - Need quick validation before launch
   - Want to identify issues early in development
   - Require actionable insights without deep accessibility expertise

3. **Developers & QA Teams**
   - Need automated accessibility checks
   - Want to catch issues before code review
   - Require code-level fix suggestions

**Secondary Users:**
- Marketing teams auditing landing pages
- Compliance teams checking accessibility standards
- Startups needing affordable UX validation

## How – The Approach

### Technical Architecture

**Frontend (Next.js 16 + TypeScript)**
- Modern React with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, beautiful UI
- Real-time loading states and error handling
- Mobile-first design

**Backend (Next.js API Routes)**
- Puppeteer for headless browser automation
- Web scraping to extract HTML, images, links, forms, styles
- Screenshot capture for visual context

**AI Integration (Anthropic Claude)**
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent analysis
- JSON parsing for structured findings
- Multi-category issue detection
- Code snippet generation for fixes

**Deployment (Vercel)**
- Serverless functions for scalability
- Edge deployment for global performance
- Environment variable management for API keys

### Development Process

1. **AI-Assisted Development**: Used Cursor AI for:
   - Code generation and structure
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - API route implementation
   - UI component design

2. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Started with basic crawler
   - Added AI analysis layer
   - Enhanced UI with visual feedback
   - Added code snippet generation

3. **Key Decisions**:
   - **Puppeteer over Playwright**: Lighter weight, sufficient for single-page analysis
   - **Claude over GPT-4**: Better structured output, more reliable JSON parsing
   - **Next.js App Router**: Modern, serverless-friendly architecture
   - **Single-page focus**: Keeps scope manageable for 8-hour constraint

### AI Tools Used

- **Cursor AI**: Primary development assistant for code generation
- **Claude API**: AI analysis engine for UX issue detection
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and suggestions

### Automation Components

- **Automated Web Crawling**: No manual inspection needed
- **Automated Analysis**: AI processes data without human intervention
- **Automated Report Generation**: Findings formatted automatically
- **Automated Screenshot Capture**: Visual context added automatically

### UX Design Principles

- **Human-Centric**: Clean, intuitive interface requiring no training
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Summary first, detailed findings on demand
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded severity levels for quick scanning
- **Actionable**: Every finding includes specific fix suggestions
- **Accessible**: Tool itself follows accessibility best practices

### Web3 Considerations (Future)

While not implemented in MVP, the architecture supports:
- **Blockchain Verification**: Audit results could be stored on-chain for immutable proof
- **Tokenized Reports**: NFTs for verified audit certificates
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven audit rule updates

## Deliverables

1. ✅ **Working Prototype**: Deployed on Vercel
2. ✅ **GitHub Repository**: Complete source code with documentation
3. ✅ **Summary Document**: This document (Why/What/Who/How)
4. ✅ **Process Documentation**: Screenshots and notes showing AI tool usage
